**Who would be the leader of the X-Men if Professor X were to die?***
## Project Summary:
For this project I used a Marvel Comic Universe network data set to analyze leader succession using graph data. The data set was put together by Ricardo Alberich, Joe Miro-Julia, and Francesc Rossell√≥ and contains co-appearances of characters in comic books in the Marvel Universe dated after 1961. The original data set had 6,426 nodes and 574,467 undirected, multiple edges.<br><br>
While the data set was based on a fictional network, it provided an excellent opportunity to explore what makes a good leader of an organization using concepts from network analysis. These techniques could be applied to real world situations.<br><br>
## Steps Involved:
- Data Preparation, Cleaning
- Data Exploration and Visualization
- Straw Poll Survey
- Using Community Detection to Identify the Separate Superhero Teams
- Determining Network Metrics that Measure a Good Leadership
- Combining these Metrics to Score Superheroes and Determine the Next Leader<br><br>
